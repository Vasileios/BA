#+TITLE: BA classes for SuperCollider

* About
BA classes are classes for Musical Live coding

Clone this repository to your SuperCollider Extensions folder

* Usage
Example of BASynthGens classes

#+begin_src
//run synth gens classes
BASynthGens()

//Then use BASelect to select an instrument and to play with patterns
//Use BASelect.list to see the list of the default instruments

BASelect.list;

//then choose an instrument from the list and play with patterns
BASelect.instrument(Pbindef(\pad, \freq, 440, \amp, 0.6).play);

//BASelect uses Pdef that registers patterns by key.
//You can play, stop, pause and resume patterns

//insert a filter to your synths
BASelect.filter(\pad).put(1, \filter->{|in| Resonz.ar(in, 2600,1,1)})

//remove filter
BASelect.filter(\pad).put(1,nil)
#+end_src

Example of BADrumKit

#+begin_src
//run drum kit
BADrumKit();

//Use BASelect to select an instrument and to play with patterns
//Use BASelect.list to see the list of the default instruments

BASelect.list;
//then choose an instrument from the list and play with patterns
BASelect.instrument(Pbindef(\kick1, \freq, 660, \amp, 0.5, \dur, 0.5).play)
//BASelect uses Pdef that registers patterns by key.
//You can play, stop, pause and resume patterns
//insert a filter to your synths
BASelect.filter(\kick1).put(1, \filter->{|in| Resonz.ar(in, 2600,1,1)})

//remove filter
BASelect.filter(\kick1).put(1,nil)
#+end_src>

*Have fun!*
